# How to install my version of FlyingFox
I use a modified version of [FlyingFox](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox) which is a project that has sadly been paused. But I fixed many of the CSS bugs surrounding the close tab button in the latest version of Firefox.

## Installation

To install, move the `user.js` to the profile directory which can be found by looking here `about:support` under `Profile Folder`. Then move the `chrome` directory into the default profile.

My version of this browser depends on [Tree Style Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/). After installation navigate to treestyletab preferences and select "Left Side" then under Appearance > themes > select "No Decoration". Finally, scroll to Advanced > Extra style rule > load from file, and select `treestyletab.css`

## Additional Theme
[OneDark Firefox Theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/one-dark-scheme/)
